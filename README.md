# Hello, I’m Basith Abdul

I’m a **Software Engineer** with 3.5+ years of experience specializing in **Full-Stack Development**, **DevOps**, **Cloud-Native Systems**, and **Generative AI (LLMs & RAG)**. Currently pursuing my **M.S. in Computer Science** at **Georgia State University**, I’m driven by a passion for building scalable, high-impact solutions that merge engineering excellence with cutting-edge AI innovation.

I’ve engineered large-scale systems—from **LLM-powered architectures at Amazon** to **next-gen self-checkout microservices at NCR Voyix**—that handle millions of transactions daily. I love solving complex problems, mentoring others, and exploring the intersection of **distributed systems, AI agents, and automation**.
